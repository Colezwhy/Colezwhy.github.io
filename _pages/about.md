Iâ€™m currently a junior student studying in Information Science Advanced Class, school
of Electronic Information & Communication, HUST. I have a great interest in many aspects in Artificial
Intelligence, especially computer vision related tasks.

I am very fortunate to be supervised by [Prof.Xinggang Wang](https://xwcv.github.io/) in HUSTVL, school of EIC, Huazhong University of Science & Technology. Before, I was advised by Prof.Meng Tang in mengtanglab as a remote intern undergraduate student, The Univerisity of California, Merced.

If you are interested in working with me or want to have a talk, please send me an email directly. Collaborations are often pleasant when persuing something.
