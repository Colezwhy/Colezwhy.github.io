Iâ€™m currently a junior student studying in Information Science Advanced Class, school
of Electronic Information & Communication, HUST. I have a great interest in many aspects in Artificial Intelligence, especially computer vision related tasks.

Now I am a visiting student at VlLab@UCMerced, supervised by Prof. [Ming-Hsuan Yang](https://faculty.ucmerced.edu/mhyang/), also working closely with [Lu Qi](http://luqi.info/) and [Xueting Li](https://research.nvidia.com/person/xueting-li), working on 3D/4D generation.
Previously, I am very fortunate to be supervised by Prof. [Xinggang Wang](https://xwcv.github.io/)@HUSTVL, Prof. [Meng Tang](mengtang.org)@mengtang lab, UCMerced.

If you are interested in working with me or want to have a chat, please send me an email directly. Always welcome!

- Expected to be seeking for Ph.D. positions in 2025 Fall!

**Research Interest**
======

- Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, Multi-modality
