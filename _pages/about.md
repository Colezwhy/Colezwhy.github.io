Iâ€™m currently a junior student studying in Information Science Advanced Class, school
of Electronic Information & Communication, HUST. I have a great interest in many aspects in Artificial Intelligence, especially computer vision related tasks.

<!-- Now I am doing a summer internship in VLLab, UCMerced, supervised by Prof Ming-Hsuan Yang, also working closely with Dr Lu Qi.  -->
I am very fortunate to be supervised by Prof. [Xinggang Wang](https://xwcv.github.io/) in HUSTVL, school of EIC, Huazhong University of Science & Technology. Before, I was advised by Prof. [Meng Tang](mengtang.org) as a remote undergraduate intern, The Univerisity of California, Merced.

If you are interested in working with me or want to have a chat, please send me an email directly. Collaborations are often pleasant when pursuing something.

- Expected to be seeking for Ph.D. positions in 2025 Fall!

**Research Interest**
