Iâ€™m currently a junior student studying in Information Science Advanced Class, school
of Electronic Information & Communication, HUST. I have a great interest in many aspects in Artificial
Intelligence, especially computer vision related tasks.

<!-- Now I am doing a summer internship in VLLab, UCMerced, supervised by Prof Ming-Hsuan Yang, also working closely with Dr Lu Qi.  -->
I am very fortunate to be supervised by [Prof.Xinggang Wang](https://xwcv.github.io/) in HUSTVL, school of EIC, Huazhong University of Science & Technology. Before, I was advised by [Prof.Meng Tang](mengtang.org) in mengtanglab as a remote undergraduate intern, The Univerisity of California, Merced.

If you are interested in working with me or want to have a talk, please send me an email directly. __Collaborations are often pleasant when persuing something.__
